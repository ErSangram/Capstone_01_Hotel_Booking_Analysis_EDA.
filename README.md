# Hotel Booking Analysis 

   Case study based on the Hotel bookings related data is vital for any hospitality business as it gives insight into booking behaviour of customers as well as channels through which bookings are made.      
  This project involves the analysis of the provided data set pertaining to Hotel bookings for City and Resort Hotels.  
Hotel industry is a complicated field for data analysis. Hotel performance depends on a lot of variables: location, room types distribution, meals, tour operators, time of the year flights capacity, etc.   

   Booking data is the one of the most granular data in the hotel industry from the perspective of the revenue: one can disclose time paterns or try to predict outcomes like wheter a booking will end up in a cancellation.    
    
   In this project I'll try to use an open dataset with information of two real hotels to answer questions of interest regarding the industry, and those hotels in particular.  
It's real booking data from two hotels: one resort hotel and one city hotel, with arrivals from july 2015 to august 2017, including a total of 21 variables.
