# Hotel Booking Analysis 

   A casee study based on Hotel bookings related data is vital for any hospitality business as it gives insight intoth  booking behaviour of customers as well as channels through which bookings are made.      
  This project involves the analysis of the provided data set pertaining to Hotel bookings for City and Resort Hotels.  
Hotel industry is a complicated field for data analysis. Hotel performance depends on a lot of variables: location, room types distribution, meals, tour operators, time of the year flights capacity, etc.   

   Booking data is the one of the most granular data in the hotel industry from the perspective of the revenue: one can disclose time patterns or try to predict outcomes like whether a booking will end up in a cancellation.    
    
   In this project I'll try to use an open dataset with information of two real hotels to answer questions of interest regarding the industry, and those hotels in particular.  
It's real booking data from two hotels: one resort hotel and one city hotel, with arrivals from july 2015 to august 2017, including a total of 33 variables.

# **Problem Statement**

The case study based on Hotel bookings-related data is vital for any hospitality business as it gives insight into the booking behaviour of customers as well as channels through which bookings are made.   
And I invested this data in this project to analyze various aspects of booking behaviour by customers to answer various business challenges faced by hotel through rigorous study of:     
*   Which type of hotel is mostly preferred by the guests?   
*   Which is the most busy month for hotel?   
*   From which country most guest come?   
*   How Long People Stay in the hotel?    
*   Type of Bookings like Transient, Transient-Party, Contractâ€“Group.
*   Which is the most preferred room type by the customers?
*   What is the most popular type of meal package?
*   If the guests have booked these properties again?
*   Cancellation rates in city hotels and Resort hotels:
*   Annually variation in ADR means Average Daily Rates in both Hotels in year 2016:


## Tableau Dashboard

The next step in this project is to create an interactive Tableau dashboard to visually represent the insights gained from the analysis. You can explore the dashboard to gain a deeper understanding of the data and findings.

**Business Objective.**   
*   Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings of Hotels.     
*   Generate insights that will be helpful for making business analyses and making appropriate business decisions.
*   Make the project also helpful for knowing and understanding various hidden business problems regarding various factors like Bookings, lead-time, service, Cancellations, Ratings and most importantly profit.
